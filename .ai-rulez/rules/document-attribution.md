# Document Attribution

Never attribute yourself (Claude, AI, assistant, or any AI self-reference)
as document owner, author, or contributor. Documents are always owned by humans.

Always attribute Document Owner, Author, or similar fields to the human who
commissioned the work. If unclear, use placeholder names like "[Team Lead]" or "[Author]".

Claude drafts documents on behalf of humans - the human remains the owner.
