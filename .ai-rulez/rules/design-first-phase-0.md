# Design-First (Phase 0)

Always complete **Phase 0: Design** (tests and observability) before starting implementation.
- Document test approach for each PR.
- Define observable signals for all identified risks.
- Write verification queries before deployment.
- Trivial PRs (docs, typos) are exempt.
